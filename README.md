# Logseq Custom Workflow Plugin
A plugin that allows you to set command workflows similar to cmd+enter for todos. 

## How to use
1. Open plugin settings
2. Define custom shortcut
3. Define the items to be looped through (i.e.)
  - Set this in the form `Item1, Item2, Item3`
4. While in editing mode, use the previously defined hotkey to loop through these commands

## Tips
- Using this method you can customize your own TASK workflow and bring advanced features like WAITING and CANCELLed into your workflow
- You can map the shortcut to `mod+enter` to replace the in built cmd enter flow for tasks with your own custom choice
